All of the number figures here are made-up, so don't be deceived. Also, I happened to be very small-minded towards HTML, CSS, JS or any kind of that stuff but I'm still learning so be happy with any journey, whether that's cooking, improving your academics, learning how to drive a car, or even learning a language/computer language.

## creeedits!?
As I said before, big thanks to Graygrids Team for making an awesome template.
I'm using this template here: https://uideck.com/templates/appvilla/).
